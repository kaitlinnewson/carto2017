### Field Trip

**Details:** Boat tour of False Creek, lunch at Granville Island Public Market, and behind the scenes tour of the City of Vancouver Archives 

Join us for the 2017 field trip! We will start with our own private boat tour of False Creek on a chartered [Vancouver Aquabus](http://theaquabus.com/), which will take us to [Granville Island Public Market](http://granvilleisland.com/public-market) for lunch (buy your own). 

After lunch at Granville Island we will take a 20 minute walk along the seawall to the [City of Vancouver Archives](http://vancouver.ca/your-government/city-of-vancouver-archives.aspx) for a behind the scenes tour. The Archives has an extensive collection of [Vancouver maps, architectural plans, and fire insurance plans](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vancouver-archives/sets/72157666436867171), and has completed a number of [major digitization projects](http://www.vancouverarchives.ca/tags/maps/) focused on this content in recent years. 

We'll then take a short walk to catch a quick bus ride back to SFU Vancouver, for a 3:45 p.m. arrival. 

Cost: $11. Includes all transportation (but not lunch!)

**Mobility issues:** If the walking involved in this field trip is a concern for you, please get in touch with [Julie Jones](mailto:jsj7@sfu.ca) so that alternate arrangements can be made.

Need to catch a flight and worried about timing? Get in touch with [Julie Jones](mailto:jsj7@sfu.ca). It may be possible to have you join us for a part of the field trip or to arrange different transportation for you.
