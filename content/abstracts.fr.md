### <a name="work1"></a>Building "deep" maps of the Great War: Critical information and modern approaches for developing integrated, interactive map exhibits using historical resources
[Rebecca Bartlett](../speakers#Bartlett), Carleton University  
[Gordon Beck](../speakers#Beck) & [Jason Brodeur](../speakers#Brodeur), McMaster University  
[Trevor Ford](../speakers#Ford), Wilfrid Laurier University

Corresponding with Canada’s 150th anniversary, the ongoing centenary of the First World War provides Canadians with an occasion to rediscover stories from a conflict that helped shape the identity of a nation. Among the many modes for communicating these experiences and events, interactive digital maps--or “deep maps”--provide a unique and powerful means of presenting information and engaging audiences. By interacting with diverse types of digitized historical materials arranged in both time and space, the user is afforded a media-rich, multidimensional experience of a story. 

To this end, the goal of this workshop is to enhance participants’ understanding of cartography and history of the Great War, and to develop their skills for using digital historical materials to create interactive and integrative map exhibits. Through a series of integrated information sessions and hands-on activities, participants will reinforce their learning by discovering and developing materials, and building their own interactive map exhibit using one (or multiple) platforms. In the process, the workshop content will address a number of common issues related to historical GIS development. 

Instructional elements of this workshop will include:

* Cartography and the great war: historical context; understanding and using grid reference systems; finding cartographic resources.
* Finding and understanding materials from the Great War
* Tackling common issues in HGIS
* Creating geospatial information from historical materials
* Developing ‘deep maps’: An introduction to a variety of platforms for creating interactive map exhibits.

### <a name="pres01b"></a>Spatial Humanities: Exploring Opportunities in the Humanities at DH@Guelph 
[Quin Shirk-Luckett](../speakers#Shirk-Luckett) & [Teresa Lewitzky](../speakers#Lewitzky), University of Guelph

How can spatial exploration and mapping help you develop new understandings and unique perspectives of fictional and historical material? 
 
Arguably all topics of research in the Humanities have some relationship with space.  Everything happens somewhere.  The general popularity and ubiquity of tools such as GPS and Google Maps have engendered a new level of spatial awareness.  Suddenly academics are presented with the opportunity to turn their bits of paper into bytes of data and create digitized versions of previously analog artefacts of history, culture, and literature.  This spatial analysis yields new ways to engage with the information, revealing new patterns, trends and understanding.
 
Not surprisingly, there has been a steady uptake in GIS usage among Humanities academics.  The results of which have been visually powerful and in many cases offer new perspectives on long studied topics.
 
In 2016, and again in 2017, we had the opportunity to offer a week-long hands-on course introducing spatial humanities through DH@Guelph summer institute.  We examined primary archival source materials; walked and mapped a fictional text; created spatial data; learned GIS processes and techniques; and explored tools for creating online exhibits of artefacts, research, and maps.  We used a heavily experiential and active learning approach to immerse the class in spatial insight, while also learning technical skills, and having fun!  We will share what we learned, what surprised us, what we improved, and what we would change next time.

### <a name="pres01d"></a>GIS lite & Online Visualization Tools in the Humanities Classroom: Tales From the Front Lines of a Librarian-Faculty Collaboration
[Deena Yanofsky](../speakers#Yanofsky) & [Nathalie Cooke](../speakers#Cooke), McGill University

Faculty-librarian collaborations are a frequent topic of discussion in the professional literature and often seen as the gold standard associated with student information literacy and IL curriculum integration on campus. Opportunities for blended, faculty-librarian course instruction, however, tend to be rare; librarians tend to be limited to teaching skills-based workshops or one-shot sessions rather than fully integrated into disciplinary courses.  Over the past few years, increased interest in digital scholarship has renewed attention toon the role of librarians and, in particular, the contributions that GIS and data librarians can make to both undergraduate and graduate education in the classroom. Courses in digital scholarship curriculum strongly reflect key aspects of librarianship, including open access, sustainable formats and tools, archives and archival theory, data sharing, information ethics, metadata, openness, and digital publication. Digital scholarship on campus provides librarians with new and meaningful opportunities to imbue syllabi and pedagogical styles with the values of librarianship.
This session will focus on a collaboration between a disciplinary faculty member and a data librarian to create and teach a digital humanities course. From librarian and archivist class visits to information and digital literacy focused projects and assignments, this course blended disciplinary concepts and course content with critical lessons on digital publication, data evaluation and usage, and archival theory to produce digital projects. The presenters will provide an overview of the course design and syllabus, show examples of class assignments, and share student feedback in an effort to extract best practices, as well as some of the lessons learned, that will help others looking to build similar on-campus collaborations.

### <a name="pres02b"></a>Vimy at 100: New Methods for Understanding and Communicating the Battle of Vimy Ridge
[Rebecca Bartlett](../speakers#Bartlett), Carleton University  
[Trevor Ford](../speakers#Ford), Wilfrid Laurier University

The First World War represents a watershed moment for Canada. During the course of four years, 620,000 Canadians were mobilized of which 67,000 Canadian lives were lost and a further 250,000 were wounded. Most visible of Canada’s war effort was the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), which fought throughout France and Belgium and cemented Canada’s contribution to the war with famed battles such as 2nd Ypres, the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Passchendaele, and the Hundred Days Offensive. As such, the historiography of Canada’s military contributions during the war has typically focused on the CEF in North West Europe. Unfortunately, beyond written text, little has been formulated to bring this research into the digital world.  

One such potential digital project is the use of scanned Commonwealth trench maps of which the originals date back to the battle itself. The Battle of Vimy Ridge is such a battle that has had a great deal of historical analysis, but is lacking in in-depth map analysis. It is proposed that through the collection of historical data, including original trench maps, and the development of a geospatial methodology; a visualization via a time generating map software could potentially catalogue a complete detailed collation of the actions taken at the battle by Canadian soldiers.  

This presentation will explore the role of Canadian soldiers at Vimy Ridge through a geographic visualization animated over time that will highlight how the Canadian Corps advanced at Vimy Ridge. Further, Rebecca and Trevor seek to explore in which way a inter-disciplinary and inter-university project has allowed for a sort of collaboration that has proved vital to the success of the project. Consequently, Vimy at 100: New Methods for Understanding and Communicating the Battle of Vimy Ridge will fill a significant historical and digital mapping gap on Canadian actions in April of 1917.

### <a name="pres02c"></a>Preserving Ontario’s Past, Today: Outcomes of the OCUL Historical Topographic Map Digitization Project 
[Kara Handren](../speakers#Handren), Scholars Portal  
[Sarah Simpkin](../speakers#Simpkin), University of Ottawa  
[Jason Brodeur](../speakers#Brodeur), McMaster University

Initiated through a grant by the Ontario Council of University Libraries in the Fall of 2014, the OCUL Historical Topographic Map Digitization Project is an endeavor to preserve and provide broad access to historical topographic maps covering Ontario at the 1:25000 and 1:63360 scales. Over the past two and a half years, participants at OCUL institutions and Scholars Portal have worked collaboratively to digitize, describe, georeference, and make available over 1100 sheets published between 1904 and 1977. Accessible through Scholars GeoPortal, this digitized collection provides historical snapshots that allow researchers, students, and the general public to travel through time to explore changes in natural and human environments.
In a follow-up to our 2015 Carto presentation, we will present the entirety of the project workflow, discuss the lessons learned and methodological improvements realized, and exhibit the project’s outcomes via a live demonstration of the Scholars GeoPortal-based interface. Additionally, we seek to present a framework and workflow for expanding this work to include all of Canada’s historical topographic maps.

### <a name="pres03a"></a>Unearthing geological history: Revealing and protecting GSC research through improved metadata and stewardship
[Francine Berish](../speakers#Berish), Queen's University

Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) members were instrumental in the exploration and mapping of Canada's geology. The information collected over the past 174 years has been distributed as publications such as maps, reports, monograph series (e.g. GSC Memoirs, Papers, Bulletin), and data. These publications are valuable because geological observations remain relevant despite age; because these publications are so detailed; and because, in general, the information cannot be found elsewhere. GSC published series include various titles and formats. Unfortunately, these details are often omitted from brief series catalogue records, making these treasures less discoverable for users. In an ecosystem that is progressively digital, large physical collections like the GSC series pose significant challenges. At Queen’s University, these important series were historically duplicated across department libraries with varying levels of description, and, at times, different classification systems. Our project focuses on improving discoverability and ease of retrieval for these series through the creation and enhancement of electronic catalogue records; by co-locating maps and documents in order to create conditions for improved stewardship and preservation; and by uniting maps with scanning equipment, information services and support.

### <a name="pres03b"></a>OK, We’ve Scanned the Maps--What Now? Reflecting on Five Years of Map Digitization
[Gordon Beck](../speakers#Beck) & [Jason Brodeur](../speakers#Brodeur), McMaster University

With the purchase of a large-format scanner in early 2012, the McMaster University Library’s Lloyd Reeds Map Collection embarked on a self-supported digitization program that aimed to increase access to and use of its special and local historical collections. Through the dedicated work of staff and students during the past five years, over 7500 maps, plans, and aerial photos have been digitized, and nearly 10000 total items have been made discoverable, and freely and openly accessible through the Library’s [Digital Archive](http://digitalarchive.mcmaster.ca/maps). As the digitization program approaches significant duration- and size-related milestones, it presents an opportunity to reflect on its successes, challenges, and lessons-learned, as well as discuss the broader questions that will direct its future development. Through this talk, we aim to explore the value of accessible, digitized map collections, while simultaneously critically assessing their place alongside physical materials in research, teaching, and public engagement.

### <a name="pres03c"></a>Time to Talk: Seeing, Holding and Sharing Print Map Collections
[Rachel Bergquist](../speakers#Bergquist) & [Emily Sugerman](../speakers#Sugerman), University of British Columbia

With the rise of the so-called “digital revolution” and in the age of “born digital,” academic libraries face challenges regarding their existing print map collections. Some universities have opted to resolve library space issues by deaccessioning cartographic materials, or to place their maps in permanent dark storage. On the other hand, print maps are enduring documentary sources of the public record; there is much to be gained from studying a print map rather than its digitised counterpart. This creates a dilemma between seeing, holding, and sharing print maps. Institutional collaboration and enhanced partnerships can preclude the loss of valuable collections and last copy materials on a large scale. Our 20-minute presentation focuses on three universities in British Columbia (Simon Fraser University, University of Victoria, and University of British Columbia) and their respective print map dilemmas.We outline some of the major challenges of print map collection maintenance, and how this impacts decision-making processes in regards to sharing and accessing print maps. We conclude by asking, will shared print map collections become the new normal for academic libraries? Is it possible to initiate effective methods for the academic community to see and hold print map collections that are shared across institutions and regions? We aim to spark conversation between map librarians about facilitating better access for hands-on collection use. It is time to talk about the future of print map collections in a collaborative shared framework amongst institutions.

### <a name="pres04a"></a>Spatial Thinking By the Numbers
[Barbara Znamirowski](../speakers#Znamirowski), Trent University

This paper will look at approaches to data visualization focusing on innovative methods of introducing spatial thinking to quantitative analysis in the social sciences. Options for visualization of quantitative data including survey microdata and aggregated statistics have evolved and now have important roles in map and data communities. Key questions which will be considered include: what leading visualization tools are used by our researchers, how do statistical packages offering mapping options influence use of more traditional mapping tools and practices, what are the key drivers for change, and what issues should client support consider when engaging our academic communities and assisting researchers with visualizing quantitative data spatially?  Examples of diverse applications and services such as cloud services, apps, software plugins and extensions will be presented in terms of trends, relevancy and use for thinking spatially.

### <a name="pres04b"></a>Digital Content and Marketing Strategies to Boost GIS Workshop Attendance
[Cynthia Dietz](../speakers#Dietz), University of Manitoba

Digital and content marketing strategies boosted attendance at GIS workshops at the University of Manitoba dramatically. The first strategy involved the development of a Geospatial Semester of seven basic to intermediate workshops that would appeal to graduate students and faculty as well as undergraduates. The content of our workshops was changed to address the top strategic research goals at the University of Manitoba.  The second strategy involved the marketing of those workshops to graduate students by the Faculty of Graduate Studies on their webpage two weeks prior to each semester and thereafter. Not to deny all U. of Manitoba affiliates an opportunity, identical workshops were offered to faculty, staff and all students within a day or two of the graduate offerings. All workshops were advertised by the Library through its subject guides.  Tools introduced in the workshops seemed to be in demand. They included visualizations using maps and charts, the use of map series, hot spot analyses showing degrees of confidence, georeferencing maps for historical analyses, analyzing satellite imagery and shoreline change, map analysis, and the use of photos, videos and webpages in a Story Map. Details will be offered concerning the attendance and registrations by department and faculty.

### <a name="pres04c"></a>Mapping en Plein Air: Painting the Way to Experiential Learning
[Francine Berish](../speakers#Berish), Queen's University

It is one thing to scan, georeference and overlay a fire insurance plan onto a contemporary base map creating an artifact—although providing some well-needed context, these maps still require  imagination. It is another thing entirely to overlay the historic features onto a life-sized, true-to-scale context, allowing tour goers to step into another world. Standing on the green grass in Douglas Fluhrer Park on the St. Lawrence River in downtown Kingston, Ontario, it is hard to imagine the once dark and industrial landscape marked with oil drums, factories and rail lines. One windy day, armed with coordinates pulled from a georeferenced fire insurance plan overlay, our smartphones, and some flags, a few of us conspired to bring social history to life by transposing the historic rail lines onto the grass using field marking paint. We began by marking the endpoints for our volunteer field painter, and by the following morning the park was transformed into an immersive backdrop for sharing oral histories from this often overlooked Inner Harbour neighbourhood of industrial waterfront. This project was the brainchild of Laura Murray and the Swamp Ward and Inner Harbour History Project (SWIHHP), and in addition to the experiential learning component provided by life-size learning, the project was also able to feature the georeferenced historical map and fire insurance plan artefacts by passing them around during the tour as well as posting them on the project blog.

### <a name="pres05a"></a>Transformation of legal Canada Lands Surveys Records to Authoritative Digital Records
[Martin Gingras]((../speakers#Gingras)), Surveyor General Branch, Natural Resources Canada

The Canada Lands Surveys Records is a collection of official survey documents dating back to the early 1800’s, which supports land transactions on the Canada Lands Survey System. This collection has been appraised by Library and Archives Canada as the most valuable geospatial collection in the Government of Canada, and includes records confirming the extent of property rights on lands such as National Parks, Territories and First Nations lands. The transformation of legal Canada Lands Surveys Records to authoritative digital records was an ambitious project that resulted in the transfer of the legal value of these physical documents to an authoritative digital record, which now can be accessed instantly on the web to support economic and social development on these lands. This session will go over the standards and the methodology used to ensure high integrity of the conversion process.

### <a name="pres05b"></a>Map Digitization at the City of Vancouver Archives

In 2015, the City of Vancouver Archives participated in a multi-departmental project to digitize, geo-rectify, and mosaic one of its most popular cartographic records, the 1912 Goad’s Atlas of Vancouver, with the goal of presenting it as a layer in the City’s publicly accessible GIS system, VanMap.  

Digital Conservator Sue Bigelow and Digital Archivist Sharon Walz will discuss the genesis and execution of the project within the context of the City of Vancouver Archives’ digitization efforts.
